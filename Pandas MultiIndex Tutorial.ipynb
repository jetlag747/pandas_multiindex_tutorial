In other words, each sublist in our labels is of the same length as the entire dataframe, and the value of each row is one of the possible values defined in our associated level (above). Looking again at our first index level ('Date'), we see values like \\[1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 4 ...\\]. There are just an enumerated representation of the options defined in our level, so 0 = '2018-07-10', 1 = '2018-07-11', 2 = '2018-07-12', 3 = '2018-07-13', etc.\n",
